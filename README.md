- This tool will allow for more efficient work in teams where all the members are not frequently in the same room.
- Team members can also remotely access the teams board.
- Allows teams to automatically generate visualizations and statistics of how their work is progressing.
 - An easier to use alternative to other agile tools with all the required features.
